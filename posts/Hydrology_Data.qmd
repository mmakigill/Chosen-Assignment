## GIS Skills

#### Full spatial and statistical analysis of solar installations in the United States. Question 8 demonstrates ability to synthesize the data into a clear explanation of which socioeconomic and technical variables are most strongly associated with distributed PV adoption, how each variable correlates with installation rates, and what limitations arise due to spatial autocorrelation in the residuals â€” highlighting that while the model identifies key predictors like EP_MINRTY and EP_NOHSDP, it may still miss important spatial factors influencing adoption patterns.
