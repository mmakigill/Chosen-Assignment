## About Me

My academic interests include water policy and management and the application of GIS to solve real-world environmental issues. Iâ€™m currently working on a project that maps climate change impacts on groundwater aquifers across California. I'm also gaining hands-on experience with tools like ArcGIS, QGIS, R, and Python.
