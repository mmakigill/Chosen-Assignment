## Academic Interests

My academic interests include water policy and management, watershed dynamics and the application of GIS to address environmental challenges in a visual way. I'm also gaining hands-on experience with tools like Microsoft Excel, ArcGIS, and R.

## Campus Involvement

I am actively involved in the Hydrology club at UCSB, and serve as both treasurer and secretary on the Executive board. As a cofounder of the club in 2023 I work with the team to organize water-related events and connect with professionals in the field of hydrology on and off campus.

# Outside the Classroom

In my personal time I love cooking new recipes and eating healthy and fufilling meals. I also love nature and dabble in landscape photography, especially since attending school near the ocean. I also love animals and on a free weekend like to visit the Santa Barbara Humane Society to adopt a dog and spoil them for the day!
