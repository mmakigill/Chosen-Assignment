    "text": "Academic Interests\nMy academic interests include water policy and management, watershed dynamics and the application of GIS to address environmental challenges in a visual way. Iâ€™m also gaining hands-on experience with tools like Microsoft Excel, ArcGIS, and R.\n\n\nCampus Involvement\nI am actively involved in the Hydrology club at UCSB, and serve as both treasurer and secretary on the Executive board. As a cofounder of the club in 2023 I work with the team to organize water-related events and connect with professionals in the field of hydrology on and off campus.\n\n\nOutside the Classroom\nIn my personal time I love cooking new recipes and eating healthy and fufilling meals. I also love nature and dabble in landscape photography, especially since attending school near the ocean. I also love animals and on a free weekend like to visit the Santa Barbara Humane Society to adopt a dog and spoil them for the day!\n\n\n\n\nMy dog and I at the beach, Spring 2024.\n\n\nChicken coconut curry with vegetables and rice.\n\n\nPhotograph from a boat in Puerto Vallarta Mexico, Fall 2022.\n\n\nVolunteering with the Santa Barbara Humane Shelter, taking a rescue out of the shelter for the day and on a walk.\n\n\nExecutive team of the Hydrology Club at UCSB presenting at the 55th Bren Hall Anniversary to faculty and alumni, Spring 2025."
